      <h2>My Hobby: Cricket</h2>
      <p>Cricket is more than just a game to me—it’s a passion. I’ve been playing cricket since childhood and enjoy everything from casual street matches to watching international tournaments like the IPL and ICC World Cup.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Why I Love Cricket</h3>
        <p>It teaches discipline, teamwork, and the ability to stay focused under pressure. Each match has a rhythm and strategy, which is what keeps it exciting. It’s a sport that demands both physical skill and mental clarity.</p>

        <h3>My Weekend Ritual</h3>
        <p>Every weekend, I meet up with friends to play cricket in a nearby park. It’s a great way to relax, stay fit, and bond over our favorite sport. I usually play as an opening batsman or sometimes a wicketkeeper.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration & Favorite Players</h3>
        <p>My cricket inspirations are MS Dhoni for his calm leadership, Virat Kohli for his passion, and Rohit Sharma for his batting skills. Watching them play motivates me to be disciplined and strategic in whatever I do.</p>
